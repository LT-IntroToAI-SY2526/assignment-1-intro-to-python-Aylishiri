# Assignment 1 - Write UP

AYLISH IRIZARRY WRITE UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
My initial experience with python was that it was a little confuding to understand. I took csa so we used java and i think java was easier to use and understand.
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
i used the ai to give me good promts to use for our ASSIGNMENT 
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
The most challenging concept was trying to figure out how to write the code and how to get them to work. The ai helped with trying to understand this because it showed me what worked and what didnt work and through that I was able to learn. 
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
I learned that Ai is very smart and is pretty accurate most of the time. The best strategy to getting the answers is by asking the ai the most clear questions.
